0 There are various kinds of visas to be eligible to work or settle in NZ.
  1) Temporarily work visa 
  2) Work to resident visa
  3) Resident visa 

1 How to get a visa?
  1) Meet the requirement in the Skill Framework --> I do.
  2) Get a job offer from an eligible employer --> there is a tool to check
and search if an employer is eligible.
  3) Body check, character check, no age restictions(except WHV)
  4) I think the key point is still the job offer, I may still need to be there
via a travel visa, and stay there for 1 or 2 months to find a job.

2 Software Engineering is in long-term-shortage list.
  1) I think the two-year plan to migrating is not too slow.
