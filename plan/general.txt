  I started working at NCS on 10th July, one month ago.
  The pay is good, the workload not so heavy, the project, Accounting Opening System is not plain meaningless.
  So I may keep working there for 2 years, but I absolutely need to learn other
technologies than ASP.NET MVC. It's so boring.

1 I have done the medical check as per request, and the result is positive:
  Fit for work. 
2 I'll bring the original medical check report to earth9.com pte ltd
  on 18th May, and fix a date to collect the new S pass. 
3 I need to spend 1 hour per day to learn the CMS based on Microsoft
  technologies.
4 I've decided to Migrate to Australia or New Zealand, I'll make detailed plans
  on it. 

2015-04-27 updates

1 Will start working for earth9.com on 18th May 2015
2 Will leave Innosys on 14th May 2015
3 Need to prepare for the new role in earth9.com before 18th May 2015
4 Need to hand over the development of the Messaging System to Gerry
5 Need to complete the source codes of the Messaging System as much as possible

1 Do I go back to China immediately after the contract expires in Innosys Pte Ltd?
2 Do I renew the contract with Innosys Pte Ltd? 
3 Do I wait for the update from earth9.com on my SP?
4 Do I go on looking for other opportunities?

The best choice would be: 

1 The most important point to consider in career is: 
 If I work on my own, where are the market, what can I do to satisfy the
 requirements to make money?
 If I work for others, do they have good(rich) customers? Are they a well org-
 anized and efficient group?
 The choice of technology is less improtant than the above points, but working on
 a good technology is also important.

2 Based on the above thinking, it's not the time for me to create my own produ-
 cts I'm afraid. I don't have enough money, and I don't know the market yet. I
 don't want to risk myself at the moment.
  It's neither the time to go back to China, I don't believe the economy is he-
 althy. So let me stay in Singapore for now.
  And if staying in Singapore and work for others, I need to find a good company
 to work for.
  Now earth9.com has gave me the job offer, and the package is good, it also has 
 many good(rich) customers. So the conclusion is:

3 I try to make sure earth9.com go on applying the SP for me, because earth9 agree-
 d to give me a very good package, and it has many good(rich) customers.

4 I'll read through the e9sop, and give my feedback to Shirley to impress her
 today.

update 2015-04-01
5 I've confirmed that earth9.com is applying the s pass for me, although the one
 who's applying does not reply to me yet, but Shirley still agrees to give me the
 job and asked HR about the application status.

6 Now, what's next?
 1) Shirely agreed to apply for my s pass on 27th Mar, 11:30 a.m., it was Friday.
 2) Assume HR applied on 30th, Monday, it has been 3 days(including today). As the
  information I collected from the web, it usually takes 1 to 2 days only to get
  the ipa, up to 10 days.
 3) So I wait till 6th, the next Monday, see if they reply me with the status.  
 4) I won't stay in ipl for these two reasons:
  a) ipl does not have an s pass quota
  b) if ipl is going to fake my salary again, it will be 4800SGD, unacceptable

1 earth9.com sent me the job offer formally, I signed and returned it to thier hr
