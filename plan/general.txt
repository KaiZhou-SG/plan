1 Do I go back to China immediately after the contract expires in Innosys Pte Ltd?
2 Do I renew the contract with Innosys Pte Ltd? 
3 Do I wait for the update from earth9 on my SP?
4 Do I go on looking for other opportunities?

The best choice would be: 

1 The most important point to consider in career is: 
 If I work on my own, where are the requirements, what can I do to satisfy the
 requirements to make money?
 If I work for others, do they have good(rich) customers? Are they a well org-
 anized and efficient group?
 The choice of technology is less improtant than the above points.

2 Based on the above thinking, it's not the time for me to create my own produ-
 cts I'm afraid. I don't have enough money, and I don't know the market yet. I
 don't want to risk myself at the moment.
  It's neither the time to go back to China, I don't believe the economy is he-
 althy. So let me stay in Singapore for now.
  And if staying in Singapore and work for others, I need to find a good company
 to work for.
  Now earth9 gave me the job offer, and the package is good, it also has many
 good(rich) customers. So the conclusion is:
3 I try to make sure earth9 go on applying the SP for me, because earth9 agree-
 d to give me a very good package, and it has many good(rich) customers.
4 I'll read through the e9sop, and give my feedback to Shirley to impress her
 today.
