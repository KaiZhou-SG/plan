1 Negotiate about the basic salary, ask for 3200SGD, agree on no less than
 3100SGD. And the annual leave, 14days. Developer is not a relax position,
 and I am not asking for a lot, 14days is the standard. And the contract
 should be 1 year, 1 month notice period.
2 The new pass is better to be SP instead of EP(which requires 4800SGD).
3 If condition 1 is agreed on, renew the contract, ask Stelli to apply for the 
 work pass for me.
4 Focus on completing the Message System, as well as assure the GoLive of the
 Transport Module.
5 Try to do a good job for myself.
