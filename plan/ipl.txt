1 Negotiate about the basic salary, ask for 3200SGD, agree on no less than
 3100SGD. And the annual leave, 14days. Developer is not a relax position,
 and I am not asking for a lot, 14days is the standard. And the contract
 should be 1 year, 1 month notice period.
2 The new pass is better to be SP instead of EP(which requires 4800SGD).
3 If condition 1 is agreed on, renew the contract, ask Stelli to apply for the 
 work pass for me.
4 Focus on completing the Message System, as well as assure the GoLive of the
 Transport Module.
5 Try to do a good job for myself.

1 earth9.com sent me the job offer formally, I signed and returned it to hr
2 now waiting for earth9.com hr to proceed applying the s pass for me
3 I won't continue working in innosys for this reason:
  3.1 innosys does not have an s pass quota, if I continue work here, I need to
 falsely declare my salary to be 4800+, I won't do that
4 what's next?
  4.1 wait for updates from earth9.com, the final result should come out within
 this week, before Friday
  4.2 if my application failed, try asking earth9.com to appeal for me
  4.3 if appeal also failed, I need to look for another job, and the salary
 has to be 4000+
