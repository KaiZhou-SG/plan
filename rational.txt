  1 There are quite a lot of jobs on .NET technologies in AU, and I'll work
on Microsoft technologies in the future 2 years. So my plan is to focus on
Microsoft technologies, and use it as my skill set to look for a job in AU.
  2 I'll investigate the various Microsoft Certifications, and make a plan
on what certifications will I take.
  3 I'll get the essential and important certifications before seeking for
a job in AU.
  4 I'll also apply for PR in Sigapore after one year.
  5 I'll create my personal website as soon as possible, and polish it on a
daily basis. My personal website will be my ID on the internet.
