  Since I've decided to focus on foss projects instead of Microsoft Technology,
what kind of skill set am I going to use to look for a job in NZ?
  Maybe I need to do a research again on this topic.

  0 Conclusion: keep working on foss projects, don't be bias on technolog-
ies.
  1 I've decided to keep working on foss projects in my spare time, cannot
put my hope on Microsoft technologies, although NZ and AU both have lots of
positions requiring Microsoft technologies.
  2 I've tried to do some ASP.NET coding and publishing, I found it really 
user unfriendly to do the whole work-flow, including requirement analysis,
design, coding, and publishing and hosting. Visual Studio only makes coding
a bit easier, but that's the least importaint aspect as per software deve-
loping activities.
  3 I've then go to Youtube.com to check-out what's Microsoft recent activ-
ities, very disapointing, the Key Notes of the Build Conference is disapp-
ointing, the Windows 10 is very disappointing. Nothing really attracted me.

  1 There are quite a lot of jobs on .NET technologies in AU, and I'll work
on Microsoft technologies in the future 2 years. So my plan is to focus on
Microsoft technologies, and use it as my skill set to look for a job in AU.
  2 I'll investigate the various Microsoft Certifications, and make a plan
on what certifications will I take.
  3 I'll get the essential and important certifications before seeking for
a job in AU.
  4 I'll also apply for PR in Sigapore after one year.
  5 I'll create my personal website as soon as possible, and polish it on a
daily basis. My personal website will be my ID on the internet.
